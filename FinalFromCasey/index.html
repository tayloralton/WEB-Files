      <p>I am Taylor and I am glad that you are here. I'm an optimistic and motivated student at the University of Colorado Boulder studying Strategic Communications with an emphasis in Public Relations. I am eager to learn more about the PR industry as I continue to get more experience through school and internships. </p>
      <p>I am minoring in Leadership Studies and Creative Technology and Design (CTD). In 2020, I was accepted as a Presidents Leadership Class Scholar, a prestigious leadership program that teaches courses on ethics, community development, and global leadership. This minor has given me insights on how leadership plays an important role in the workplace.</p>
      <p>My CTD minor has introduced me to the complex, yet rewarding, Adobe softwares. So far, my classes have focused on Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe XD, and Adobe InDesign. This minor will be beneficial to my future career because I will be able to use these tools to make my work more visually appealing and effective.</p>
      <p>Outside of school, I enjoy running, hiking, swimming, and weight training. I have been training for running races, like half marathons, for about 6 months and have a dream of running a marathon one day.</p>
